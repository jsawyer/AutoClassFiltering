Pivot Filtering:

I. Co-occurence Matrix:
   The co-occurence matrix gives a measure of the probability that a company is listed under
  any given pair of headings. These probabilities are determined based on the amount of money
  other companies invest in both headings.

II. Pivot Filtering:
   The filter is given a company and list of possible headings. Each heading is given a raw 
  score that represents the confidence that the heading belongs.
 A. Initial Pivots:
    The filter chooses some headings to initially pivot from. It chooses the initial pivots
   based on the raw score. The top "cluster" of headings are used. That is the clear outliers
   that have the highest score are used.
 B. Pivoting:
    Using the co-occurence matrix, the program determines the probability that the remaining
   headings belong given that the intial pivot headings belong. Using these probabilities the
   program gives each heading a co-occurence score.
 C. Filtering:
    Then the program pivots from each heading that now has a positive co-occurence score.  The
   program keeps all headings that have a co-occurence score greater than the average of the
   non-zero co-occurence scores for all the headings.
